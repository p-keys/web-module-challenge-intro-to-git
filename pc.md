## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
	Git is a version control system. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

3. Why do we create a branch?
	So that in the main we can keep everything that is working and reviewed. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
	We use pull requests to make sure that everything that gets merged to the main branch is reviewed and doesn't break other parts of the project.

	git checkout "branchname" 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
	git fetch downloads files from remote servers, git merge will merge multiple branches into one, and git pull will download the remote repository and automatically update your local repository.
7. What is a merge conflict?
	This is when branches are merging and the code conflicts with each other causing a merge conflict. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
	You will have to choose which branche's code you would like to keep.
